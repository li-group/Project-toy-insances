    "\n",
    "The Big Gear (BG) transmission company buys and distributes replacement transmissions for large, 18-wheeler trucks. For the next 4 months, the company anticipates demands of 100, 130, 95, and 300 units, respectively. During the first month, units can be purchased from BGâ€™s supplier at a cost of `$`12K each, but thereafter the price goes to `$`14K per transmission. One order will be placed at the beginning of each month, and goods arrive immediately. Units can be held in the Big Gear warehouse at a cost of `$`1.2K per unit held per month, but there is no starting inventory. Naturally, the company wants to meet demand over the finite 4-month horizon at minimum total cost."
