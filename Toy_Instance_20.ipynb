    " Mama’s Kitchen serves from 5:30 A.M. each morning until 1:30 P.M. Tables are set and cleared by busers working 4-hour shifts beginning on the hour from 5 A.M. through 10 A.M. Most are college students who hate to get up in the morning, so Mama’s pays 7 dollars per hour for the 5, 6, and 7 a.m. shifts, and 6 dollars per hour for all others. The manager seeks a minimum cost staffing plan that will have 2 busers on duty for the hour beginning at 5 A.M., plus 3, 5, 5, 3, 2, 4, 6 and 3 on duty for the hours to follow.\n",
